1. What is React.js?
Answer: React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the view when data changes.

2. What is JSX?
Answer: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX allows writing HTML structures in the same file as JavaScript code, making component creation intuitive.

3. What are components in React?
Answer: Components are the building blocks of a React application. They split the UI into independent, reusable pieces. There are two types: Functional components (stateless, use hooks for state) and Class components (stateful, use lifecycle methods).

4. What is the Virtual DOM?
Answer: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM kept in memory by React. When state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, then efficiently updates only the changed parts in the real DOM, improving performance.

5. What are props and state?
Answer:

Props are inputs passed from parent to child components, making components reusable and dynamic.

State is data managed within a component that can change over time, triggering re-renders when updated.

6. What are hooks in React?
Answer: Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks.

7. What is the Context API?
Answer: The Context API allows you to share values (like theme, user info) across the component tree without passing props at every level, helping avoid "props drilling".

React.js Interview Questions & Answers
1. Explain the React component lifecycle.
Answer: Class components have lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount for handling side effects at different stages. Functional components use the useEffect hook to achieve similar effects.

2. What is props drilling and how do you avoid it?
Answer: Props drilling is passing data through many nested components via props, even if only the deepest child needs it. You can avoid it using the Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

3. What are React Fragments?
Answer: Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM, using <></> or <React.Fragment>.

4. What is useMemo and when should you use it?
Answer: useMemo is a hook that memoizes the result of an expensive calculation, recomputing it only when dependencies change. Use it to optimize performance when passing complex objects or functions as props.

5. What is Redux and how does it work with React?
Answer: Redux is a state management library. It centralizes the app’s state in a store, and components interact with it via actions and reducers. Redux is useful for large applications with complex state needs.

6. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
Answer:

Controlled components have their form data managed by React state.

Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally using refs.

7. How does React Router handle navigation in a single-page app?
Answer: React Router enables client-side routing, allowing navigation between views without full page reloads. It updates the URL and renders the corresponding component.

8. What is React Strict Mode?
Answer: React Strict Mode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application, such as unsafe lifecycle methods and legacy API usage. It helps write more robust code.

9. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?
Answer: HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced functionality, commonly used for code reuse and cross-cutting concerns.

10. What is reconciliation in React?
Answer: Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently by comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one and applying only the necessary changes


**Advanced React.js Learning Questions & Answers**

1. What are custom hooks in React?
Answer: Custom hooks are JavaScript functions whose names start with "use" and can call other hooks. They allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic across multiple components, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

2. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
Answer:

Controlled components have their form data managed by React state, making them predictable and easier to validate.

Uncontrolled components manage their own state internally using refs, which is useful for integrating with non-React code or for simple use cases.

3. What is the purpose of the key prop in React lists?
Answer: The key prop uniquely identifies elements in a list, helping React efficiently update and reorder items by tracking changes, insertions, and deletions.

4. What are React Fragments and why are they used?
Answer: React Fragments (<></> or <React.Fragment>) let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM, keeping the DOM tree clean and lightweight.

5. What is the difference between the Virtual DOM and the Shadow DOM?
Answer:

Virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM used by React for efficient UI updates.

Shadow DOM is a browser technology for encapsulating DOM and CSS in web components, isolating styles and markup.

6. What is the Context API and when should you use it?
Answer: The Context API lets you share values (like theme or user data) deeply in the component tree without prop drilling. Use it for global state that needs to be accessed by many components.

7. What are the main types of hooks in React?
Answer:

Basic hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext

Additional hooks: useReducer, useCallback, useMemo, useRef

Custom hooks: User-defined hooks for reusable logic.

Advanced React.js Interview Questions & Answers
1. What are the different phases of the React component lifecycle?
Answer:

Mounting: constructor, getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount

Updating: getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate

Unmounting: componentWillUnmount.

2. How do you optimize performance in a React application?
Answer:

Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Use useMemo and useCallback to memoize expensive calculations and functions.

Split code using React.lazy and Suspense.

Avoid large component trees and unnecessary state updates.

3. What is the difference between Redux and Context API?
Answer:

Redux provides a robust global state management system with middleware, dev tools, and predictable state updates, suitable for large-scale applications.

Context API is simpler and best for sharing state that doesn’t require complex logic or middleware, suitable for small to medium apps.

4. What are higher-order components (HOCs) and what are their use cases?
Answer: HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced behavior. Use cases include code reuse, logic abstraction, and cross-cutting concerns like authentication or theming.

5. What does the three dots (...) syntax mean in React?
Answer: The three dots are the spread operator. In React, it is used to pass all properties of an object as props, copy arrays/objects, or merge them.

6. How do you avoid binding in React class components?
Answer: Use arrow functions as class properties, which automatically bind this, or bind methods in the constructor.

7. What is React Strict Mode?
Answer: Strict Mode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application, such as unsafe lifecycle methods and legacy API usage. It is enabled by wrapping components in <StrictMode>.

8. What are the main components of Redux?
Answer:

Store: Holds the state.

Actions: Describe what happened.

Reducers: Specify how the state changes in response to actions.

9. What is prop drilling and how do you solve it?
Answer: Prop drilling is passing data through multiple nested components. It can be solved using Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

10. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React and why is it important?
Answer: SSR renders React components on the server and sends HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO. Frameworks like Next.js enable SSR in React apps.

These questions and answers cover advanced React concepts and are suitable for both deep learning and interview preparation. For further practice, focus on real-world scenarios and hands-on coding, as well as the latest features like concurrent rendering and server components
